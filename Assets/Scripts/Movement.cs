/*
    The using UnityEngine; statement in your Unity script gives you access to all the basic tools
    and features of the Unity game engine. This includes creating and managing game objects,    
    handling player input, working with physics, rendering graphics, playing sounds,    
    and debugging your game. Essentially, it lets you use all the essential components 
    you need to build and control your game in Unity.

/*
    A namespace in C# is like a container that helps organize your code and avoid name 
    conflicts. It groups related classes, functions, and other code elements together, 
    making your code easier to manage and read. For example, Unity uses the UnityEngine 
    namespace to group all the core game engine features in one place.

        The [RequireComponent(typeof(CharacterController))] attribute in Unity ensures 
        that the GameObject this script is attached to also has a CharacterController 
        component. If the GameObject doesn't already have one, Unity will automatically add it.
        This helps prevent errors and ensures that your script has everything it 
        needs to work properly.

        In Unity, public class YourClassName : MonoBehaviour means you're creating a new

            [SerializeField] makes private fields visible and editable in the Inspector.
            [Header("This is a title")] adds a labeled header above a field in the Inspector.
            [Space(10)] adds some spacing between fields in the Inspector.
            [Tooltip("Hover Description")] shows a helpful description when you hover over a field in the Inspector.
            [Min(minValue)]: Ensures the value of the field is never less than the specified minimum value.
            [ContextMenuItem("FunctionName", "ContextMenuTitle")]: Adds a context menu item to the field in the Inspector, 
            allowing you to call a specified function.
            [TextArea(minLines, maxLines)]: Similar to [Multiline], but you can specify the minimum and maximum lines for the text area.
            [Multiline]: Makes a string field display as a multi-line text area in the Inspector.
            [HideInInspector]: Hides a public field in the Inspector.
            [Range(min, max)]: Allows you to set a range for a numeric field, which creates a slider in the Inspector.
            These attributes make it easier to organize and understand your script settings in the Unity Editor.
